# About

<div class="bio">
<div>
<p>I am a fullstack web developer at <a href="https://www.redwoodtech.com/">Redwood Technologies</a> in Bracknell, UK. I have a passion for technology and music and how this can be used to glorify God in His Church. I'm married to Claire and we both attend <a href="https://kerith.church">Kerith Community Church</a> together.</p>
<p>When developing I tend to use a full TypeScript or JavaScript stack, using either Vue or React on the frontend and Express or .NET Core on the backend. You can see recent examples of what I've been up to on the <router-link to="/projects">projects page</router-link>.</p>
<p>When making music I usually play keys and run all sounds and loops from Ableton.</p>
