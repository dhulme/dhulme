        <p>What with making sure you've remembered everything, carrying the
          mountain loud of stuff you've brought to uni, finding your room, saying
          goodbyes and meeting new flat mates, moving in to halls is potentially
          one of the most stressful aspects of your Freshers' week experience.
          But don't worry – your CU is here to help! We'll be in blue t-shirts or
          hoodies welcoming you when you arrive and helping you get your keys,
          find your room and move your stuff in. There'll be a team of us at every
          hall throughout the move in weekend, so wherever you're headed you can
          be sure to find some of Southampton's finest ready to give a helping
          hand.</p>

      </div>
      <div id="freeBBQMoreInfo" class="more-info">
        <p>Who doesn't love a good British BBQ? (Especially when you're away from 
        home cooking and have probably managed to burn the toast that very morning.)
        This is a fantastic opportunity to get to know other people from your halls
        and also a great chance to meet some second and third years from the CU.
        This event is completely free and will be taking place at the BBQ sites in
        Glen Eyre, Chamberlain, Monte, Connaught and Bencraft at 13:00. Highfield
        halls will also be putting on a BBQ at 13:00, but this will take place on
        Southampton Common just opposite those halls. For more details about the
        BBQ that will be taking place in your halls, have a look at the posters
        that will be in the windows of the receptions and most of the entrances
        to the various blocks. Whatever you do, don't miss out on this great
        opportunity for free food and fun.</p>

        <p>This is another great opportunity to get to know other students within
        the CU, both in your year and halls and also from the years above and other
        halls. It's also a good opportunity to become more familiar with the
        Southampton area as we'll meet at the bus interchange on campus at 14:00
        and take a fifteen minute walk past Sainsbury's, down Portswood Road and
        then spend however long people want to hang around for in the luxurious
        Trago Lounge, where we'll be talking, chilling, playing card games and
        enjoying the fine drinks on offer.</p>

      </div>
      
      <div id="hallGroupSocialMoreInfo" class="more-info">
        <p>Each hall has its own Hall Group for first years that meets weekly on
        a Tuesday evening. Hall groups meet in your common room from 19:30 and
        will usually include refreshments, some random get-to-know-you games, a
        Bible Study and a time of prayer. However, the social will simply be a
        relaxed chance to meet your Hall Group leaders and some fellow Freshers
        over a pizza. For more information about the specific location of your
        Hall Group then see the poster that also advertised the BBQ and can be

        <p>One of the most hectic events you'll experience during Freshers Week.
        All the societies on campus (and that's a lot) will be crammed into
        sports halls trying to get you to join their society. It might be handy
        to have a fake email address at the ready... Amidst all the madness will
        be a CU stall, where second and third years from the CU would love to
        meet you and sign you up to be part of the Southampton University
        Christian Union.</p>

        <p>Yes, that's right – more free food. These events will be taking place
        in Glen Bar and Mote Bar and will start at 13:00. It doesn't matter what
        hall you're in, just go to whichever Bar is closer to you and take yourself
        and your flat along for a free lunch of a baguette, hot and cold drinks
        and cake. There'll be a twenty minute talk on "The Meaning of Life:
        Freshers' Week and Beyond" with a short time for Q&amp;A afterwards.</p>

        <p>Definitely a food-related theme going on here, it's almost like you're
        students or something. One of the best things about the city of Southampton
        is its Common. So we're giving you the chance to get away from the concrete
        jungle of halls and all the Freshers' Week queues and escape to the lush
        greenery. We'll meet at the bus interchange on campus at 16:00 and take
        the fifteen minute walk to the Common together. They'll be a free picnic
        provided and hopefully, if the weather holds up, we'll have some
        guitarists joining us along with some fairly relaxed games like Frisbee
        and rounders going on.</p>

        atmosphere with free pizza and drinks accompanied by some live music.
        This event is for all the Freshers, so it's a great chance to meet all your
        fellow first years in the CU and get to know people from other halls too.

        at 21:00 and will take place in the main lecture theatre of Building
        32 (EEE) on Highfield campus. There will be more blue t-shirts pointing you
        in the right direction! This is a fantastic opportunity to see the whole
        of the CU from first to fifth years, meet some really interesting people
        and have fellowship together. It'd be great to see you there.</p>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>Above Bar Church exists to glorify God by seeking to make and mature disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. We seek to bless all areas of our city, nation and world.</p>

      <h3>Times and number of services</h3>
      <p>11am (with Student Lunch), 6.30pm (join us in the Pub afterwards) & 9.15am.</p>

      <h3>Mid-week Meetings/Events</h3>
      <p>HUNGRY, our weekly gathering is the foundation of our student community. Expect a tasty home-cooked dinner, a talk, worship and time to look at God’s word and pray for one another in small groups. We meet at 6.30pm, Wednesdays in a home near the uni. </p>
      
      <h3>Community involvement</h3>
      <p>We seek to bless all areas of our city. On an average week you’ll find the homeless in for breakfast, people from 0-100 spending time together, and we are having an increasingly International feel. If you’ve got a passion that we are not currently meeting we’d love to support you as you do this.  </p>

      <h3>Worship and teaching</h3>
      <p>As a community we hope to live bible centred lives, so it’s no surprise that most of our gatherings place a high emphasis on exploring the Bible. We hope that our teaching and worship are relevant and engaging. </p>

      <h3>Student work</h3>
      <p>For as long as we can remember, hundreds of students have chosen to make Above Bar Church their church during their time at university. We have a midweek gathering and other lunches, days away, services in the pub. Aside from this our students love to spend time with each other and you’ll find us involved in all areas of University life</strong>: sports, music, drama and of course the CU. Our student worker, Ruth or one of our ministers, Paul would love to get to know you! and see how we can support you at your time at uni. </p>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>90 weeks. Give or take. That's your lot. It's how long a typical university student will spend here in Southampton, once you take out holidays. 90 weeks. And we at Christ Church are determined to make every one of them count for you. By the time you graduate, we want you to leave with your faith deepened, your mind stretched and your Christ-like character more firmly established. More than that, we want you to finish your time at university trained and equipped for a lifetime of serving Jesus, whatever that may look like for you.</p>
      
      <h3>Times and number of services</h3>
      <p>10.30am at Cantell School – this morning service is a chance to be part of a 'normal church' and to experience the feel of the family. There's contemporary music, heartfelt prayer and in-depth Bible-teaching. There are free student lunches starting on the 29 September and on into October where you can hear more about the church and get to meet the 50 or so students who already call Christ Church home. We are also excited to be launching a new evening service, which we anticipate starting at the end of October.</p>
      
      <h3>Worship and teaching</h3>
      <p>We’re a growing independent evangelical church, affiliated with the South East Gospel Partnership. We put a high value on clear, contemporary and challenging Bible-teaching.  We prioritise fellowship, evangelism and discipleship, and also want our church to be one in which you feel confident about bringing your seeking friends to.  These things are part of our DNA at Christ Church, and we, with the help of God, work hard to keep on developing them.</p>
      
      <h3>Student work</h3>
      <p>Student Connect is our main student meeting and is on Sunday at 6.30pm.  The evening starts with everyone enjoying a hot meal together, which is followed by a short talk, on a relevant area of living the Christian life as a student. This is then followed by a chance to get our Bibles open in small groups to study and pray together. It’s a vibrant atmosphere and you'll find it stretching, stimulating, encouraging, and equipping.</p>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>Students are an integral part of City Life, with many finding their home in the church and building into Connect groups and Missional Communities.  Our desire is to join students into the life of the church; to grow their faith and encourage them to serve the overall vision. We want them equipped, encouraged and released to bring the Kingdom of God into their halls, houses and on campus. </p>
      
      <h3>Times and number of services</h3>
      <p>We have two celebrations every Sunday at 286. Burgess Road, The first starts at 10am, the second at 10:30am.  The first is an all age time of learning and encounter that is primarily aimed at families, the second is more suited to adults and students with more in depth and Spirit-led teaching from our current theme.  The celebrations have a lively overlapping time of worship and testimony, as well as a shared refreshments break.</p>
      
      
      <h3>Community involvement</h3>
      <p>There are a variety of Connect groups that meet during the week. We also have several missional communities that reach out to particular people groups or neighbourhoods as well as being very active in the local community and more broadly in the city both running community projects and serving others – there are plenty of opportunities to connect, be supported and get involved in practically demonstrating and sharing the good news and we encourage people to do so!</p>
      
      <h3>Student work</h3>
      <p>Many students are away from home for the first time and life can sometimes feel difficult and lonely.  We have an 'adopt a student' scheme where others in the church family provide a home-cooked meal, a warm welcome and a listening ear.   Our student team regularly puts on events and activities for students and those in the 20-30s age range and we also have regular connecting points where we can catch up over a coffee or drink. At the start of the academic year, we run 'Welcome Lunches' so that those new to the church, including students, have an opportunity to hear our vision ask questions and meet some of the existing City Life members. Lunches are held on a Sunday after the church meeting.</p>

      <h3>Mid-week Meetings/Events/Community involvement</h3>
      <p> Mid week the church has cell groups scattered around the Southampton and Solent area that meet in people’s homes to equip, inspire and grow every member of the church. If you want a quiet life then KCC isn’t for you! We run a number of different works on Sundays and throughout the week, working with children and young people, Alpha, luncheon club for the elderly, Parent and Toddler groups, and a “Kidz Club” in Thornhill,  a local housing estate.  All of these works have an outreach focus and provide great opportunities for students to get involved not just in church life but also in the community. We also have a strong passion in working overseas, serving a number of churches and work with the poor across four continents.</p>

      
      <h3>Worship and teaching</h3>
      <p>We value worship and preaching that is filled with the Spirit and solidly founded on truth, in which we celebrate God and all that He has done for us and seek to be challenged and equipped by Him for His calling on our lives.</p>
            
      <h3>Transportation</h3>
      <p>We run a mini-bus from Glen Eyre and Wessex Lane Halls of Residence, as well as outside the Highfield Hotel on Highfield Lane to our meeting.   </p>
      
      <h3>Student work</h3>
      <p>We have a designated student team to offer pastoral support to students and to help integrate you into the vibrant family life of the church.  A sense of family in the church is of great importance to us. We offer Student Lunches to help you get to know people within the church, alongside other worship/teaching events specifically aimed at the student and young professional age group. </p>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>We are a community of people of all different ages and backgrounds who follow Jesus and believe and teach from the Bible because it shows us how to be reconnected with God. We are committed to the absolute authority and accuracy of Scripture, and committed to experiencing (and not merely believing in) the presence and power of the Holy Spirit today, eagerly desiring spiritual gifts and especially prophecy, taking the book of Acts as a vision of what church life can be rather than a record of what it once was.</p>
      
      <h3>Times and number of services</h3>
      <p>We meet every Sunday at Harbour Lights, in Ocean Village from 10am.</p>

      <h3>Mid-week Meetings/Events</h3>
      <p>We gather in homes across the city during the week and also run events and activities such as Mum’s and Toddlers, Youth and Student events, and courses such as Alpha, Gospel Revolution and Freedom in Christ. We also have a weekly prayer meeting and a range of evening meetings which focus on theology, prayer or worship.</p>
      
      <h3>Community involvement</h3>
      <p>One of our greatest passions at Life Church is to engage with those who don' yet know Jesus, and may never have heard the gospel. We ensure this happens through every aspect of church life and we also intentionally spend time on the High Street for two hours, twice a week, solely for this purpose. We also enjoy hosting a Saturday Breakfast in conjunction with three other city churches to feed those who are in need.</p>
      
      <h3>Worship and teaching</h3>
      <p>Our main Sunday Celebrations have a contemporary feel with modern music and relevant teaching from scripture.</p>
      
        <h3>Transportation</h3>
        <p>Grab a U1C or U6C Uni-link bus to Ocean village (just along from Dock Gate Four) and come join us at Harbour Lights Picture House for 10am this Sunday.</p>
      
      <h3>Student work</h3>
      <p>We have a vibrant group of students, young professionals, and married couples in their 20's who are involved across the breadth of church life. The team organise regular gatherings and events with a vision to strengthen relationships for ‘doing life together’, standing alongside one another, praying and strengthening each other as they seek to put their gifts to use in extending the Kingdom of God, and fulfil their own calling as a follower of Jesus. We are organising a series of five free lunches for freshers and students from the beginning of term.</p>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>Church isn't a place for us to come and show off our goodness, it is a gathering of people who come together to celebrate the goodness and love of Jesus Christ.

      <p>We have regularly had students in the church for the last 10 years. We organise for students to have lunches at people's houses every Sunday. As well as giving you a good meal this is a great way to get to know people of every age group in the church and build community. From October we will be running "The Big Lunch" monthly where we will gather all the students for a discussion of how the Bible relates to the world we live in.</p>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>We are a diverse community of about 200 people Centred on Christ wanting to grow towards God in worship and learning, towards one another in love as we follow Jesus together, and outwards into the wider world in mission.  This is only possible through the Holy Spirit as we depend upon God in prayer and we learn to live Jesus-shaped lives through Bible teaching and small groups. </p>
      
      <h3>Times and number of services</h3>
      <p> Sunday morning 10.00-11.30 is the main gathering of the Church family. Sunday evenings get used for one-offs (Big Question Times), short courses (Christianity Explored, Discipleship Explored and other groups. We also have a midday ‘reflection’ at midday on Thursdays as part of our Community Programme. </p>
      
      <h3>Community involvement</h3>
      <p>We’re involved in a number of ways – Fun Days, and similar events (3 Saturdays a year) using our high-street location. Weekly pre-school and other family ministries, a monthly breakfast club for ‘street people’, Community Café, with internet (Thursday mornings) along with English Classes. There’s a lot going on and it’s great if students are able to volunteer with us, if they’d like to. </p>
      
      <h3>Worship and teaching</h3>
      <p>Worship together, led by the band, is an important part of our main gatherings. Sermons are about 30-35 minutes and we teach out of a Bible passage – usually as part of a series going through sections of the Bible systematically. </p>
      
      <h3>Student work</h3>
      <p>There’s a student group which meets for food, friendship and prayer. We encourage students to be in house groups from their second year on. There’s a new initiative underway called ‘life in 3D – following Jesus in your third decade’ or students and 20s meeting Sunday evenings twice a month. Generally we just want students to be as at home and involved in the whole church rather than in a student sub-group within it.</p>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>We believe that God has called us to nurture a passionate, worshipping family of believers, reaching out to a generation in need. We are a family church seeking to love the lost and alleviate suffering & poverty around us. </p>

      <p>We meet together every Sunday at 10.30am –12.15 pm at Bitterne Park Junior School, Manor Farm Road, Bitterne Park, S018 1NX. </p>

      <h3>Mid-week Meetings/Events</h3>
      <p>Our Housegroups meet on Wednesday or Thursday evenings in homes across the city for bible study, prayer, meals, social action, support and fun. It is our desire to be a church where people really love & care for each other and can learn & grow together in their faith. </p>
      
      <h3>Community involvement</h3>
      <p>A strong feature of ‘us’ is our sense of community with one another and a sense of our place within our community/city. We’re based in ‘The Old Chemist’ (in Bitterne Triangle) from where we run community groups & events. We also run a CAP centre (Christians Against Poverty – debt advice & relief) and work closely with Southampton City Mission & Basics Bank to support and serve those in need in our city. </p>
      
      <h3>Worship and teaching</h3>
      <p>Each of the Housegroups takes turns to lead the Sunday service so that our corporate worship is a reflection of our church community. Matt Hyam, our senior Pastor, along with a team of speakers, teaches each week. Whether it’s a Sunday morning meeting, a housegroup meeting or just hanging out together as friends, we try to apply everything we learn from the Bible to our normal, everyday lives.</p>
      
      <h3>Student work</h3>
      <p>We’re a 10 min walk through Riverside Park from Monte & Wessex Lane Halls – what a beautiful start to your Sunday!</p>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>SBC is a local Christ centered community seeking to live together with kindness patience and respect, forgiving one another in love, working out our faith in service;  building bridges for God’s grace to all sorts of people. </p>

      <p>Our service on a Sunday morning starts at 10.30am. In the evening we enjoy “open house” a time for conversation and food twice a month and a prayer meeting once a month.</p>

      <h3>Mid-week Meetings/Events</h3>
      <p>The worship mixes the best of old and new whilst the teaching which is either thematic or based on a biblical book takes the bible seriously whilst seeking to apply it to life in the 21st century.  </p>
      
      <h3>Worship and teaching</h3>
      <p>Many are Southampton University graduates and so know exactly what university life is like. As part of our family we will support you in growing in your relationship with God and sharing the Gospel with your friends. One of the ways we do this is to offer mentoring to any student who would like it.</p>
      
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>On a Sunday morning we have up to 50 people of different ages and nationalities who meet together to study the Bible, praise God,  pray and encourage and support each other. If you are looking to find a home in a local church family then we are the place for you. Rather than a student stream we support each other as a whole church family. There are small groups each week and there is often an invite to a free lunch after church on a Sunday which is open to anyone. Students are welcome to get involved with any part of church life. There’s music group, kids’ groups, messy church, Monday lunch and plenty more.</p>
