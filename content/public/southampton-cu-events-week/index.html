          the issues that you raised and we lay on an excellent free lunch. You 
          get a big baguette, some cake and drinks. If that wasn't enough, 
          there'll also be live music and a chance to ask the speaker questions 
          afterwards. Everyone is welcome, whatever you believe.</p>
