You can read the abstract below and the paper <a href="/files/multimedia-and-the-semantic-web.pdf">here</a>.

> With the advent of Web 2.0 and user-generated content, the amount of multimedia on the Web is growing.

This paper researches the process of making multimedia data accessible to the Semantic Web and applications that could become possible.
