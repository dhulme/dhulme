title: Viability of HTML5 Video - Individual Research Project
---

<BlogPostHeader />

For my fourth year individual research project I investigated the viability of HTML5 video as a method of delivering video content to users. You can read the abstract below and the paper <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15460305/dhulme.co.uk/irp.pdf">here</a>.

> HTML5 defines a method for videos to be embedded directly into a web page. The ability to directly embed videos into web pages removes the web browser's dependence on third party software and opens up new possibilities for the integration of video multimedia with other web content.

> However, for any new web technology to gain acceptance it must be comparable to the current technology in use. In this paper, an examination of the viability of HTML5 video as a replacement for the current plug-in based technologies in use is conducted, as well as research into the new opportunities it can provide.
