title: Easy Design - Web Application
---

<BlogPostHeader />

A fourth year module tasked me to develop an enterprise web site. I developed Easy Design &#8211; a service designed to help customers such as charities and organisations to quickly produce well designed logos, posters and flyers based on user generated content. A prototype application was produced in Ruby on Rails to show the main functionality of the site: uploading content, discovering content, downloading content, reviewing content and system management. The video clip below shows the site in action.
