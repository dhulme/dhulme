Last Semester, as part of a group coursework, we had to produce a web application using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>. The application could do anything we wanted, the only constraint being that we had to use Python for server-side scripting, and JavaScript for the client side. Our group chose to produce an learning tool to teach First Year Computer Scientists Java programming.

It was a great project to work on, and I really enjoyed the process of learning JavaScript and <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Python Django</a>, as well as playing some more with with HTML/CSS.
