title: Synote Second Screening - Group Design Project

---

<BlogPostHeader />

As part of a group I helped to develop a web application for a real world client. We developed Synote Second screening. The system allows users to add collaborative annotations to a video in real-time through a second screen experience. You can see a video demo of the system <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sozWk-vvW-A&#038;feature=youtu.be">here</a>.

We developed the system using Node.js with the intention for our system to be integrated with an existing system at a later date, thus good design was essential.
