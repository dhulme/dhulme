I've been using Money Manager to manage my day to day finances for over a year now and it's become pretty stable. But there's been some small bugs and additional features that I've finally got round to doing! The new version is now available to download and install and includes new features like automated backups and importing transactions from your bank, as well as many bug fixes. Check out the release notes for more information!
