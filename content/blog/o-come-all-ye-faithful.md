title: O Come All Ye Faithful Backing Track

<BlogPostHeader />

As part of our Christmas Day meeting at Kerith Community Church, I produced a backing track in Ableton based on Bethel Kids&#8217; version of &#8216;O Come All Ye Faithful&#8217;. Most sounds featured on the track are from Spectrasonics Omnisphere, with some additional sounds from Native Instruments libraries.

You can listen to the track below, or as part of the worship set <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3I-i0gAKas">here</a>.
