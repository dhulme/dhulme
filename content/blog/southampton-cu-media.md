Over the past year I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to become  more involved with media production at <a title="SUCU" href="http://sucu.org.uk/">Southampton University Christian Union</a>. As well as gaining better understanding of Adobe&#8217;s Creative Suite, I&#8217;ve been able to collaborate on several projects with my great friend <a href="http://davebetts.org.uk">Dave Betts</a> composing the accompanying music to the videos.

One of these collaborative projects was a video to promote a week of events put on by the CU entitled &#8216;Uncover&#8217;. The events week video was interesting to work on as it built upon existing ideas from <a title="UCCF" href="http://uccf.org.uk">UCCF</a>, I was able to use their original footage, and add elements to created a promo video suitable for our specific events week.

I&#8217;ve also recently produced a promotional video for <a title="Alpha" href="http://alpha.org">Alpha</a>. Creating this was entirely different  with the inspiration coming from a <a href="http://vimeo.com/25227351">video</a> produced for <a title="Kerith" href="http://kerith.co.uk">Kerith Community Church</a> a while ago. I used the same music, and produced something with a similar style and theme.
