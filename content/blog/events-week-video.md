title: Events Week Video

Back before Christmas, I was asked (with my friend Dom) to design and produce a promotional video for the Southampton University Christian Union upcoming Events Week in February 2012. There was not much of a brief to go by, so we took some inspiration from a Willow Creek video advertising the Leadership Summit 2011 (watch this <a title="Leadership Summit 2011" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHuRDArYi14">here</a>).

I then brought together some initial concept ideas for the video in Adobe Premiere &#8211; including text, images and backgrounds from various free sources (such as <a title="Worship Backgrounds" href="http://www.worship-backgrounds.com/">this one</a>). The idea was to have some sort of storyboard of ideas that could then be developed further into the final video.

To do this I used Adobe After Effects CS 5.5, which I spent a couple of hours learning through their tutorials as well as using tutorials on YouTube of how to achieve certain effects (such as typing). One issue was that we were constrained by using trails of the program &#8211; in total we got through three trail periods on three different computers!

After multiple revisions and the addition of a Hillsong backing track (With Everything), which Dom had chopped to the right length and added extra instruments and effects in Garage Band, we had the final video produced (see below).

This was a great project to work on as I gained my first experience of creating a video in After Effects, as well as learning to listen to a lot of different criticism from many people, and sifting through to choose the comments I wanted to take on board.
