<BlogPostHeader />

Back in 2010 I wrote a post about my old Sharp ZQ-770 handheld organiser. In <a href="zq-770">that post </a>I added a few links to download some programs written for the device as well as the SDK. Recently I was clearing some stuff out from my parent&#8217;s loft and I found the organiser as well as some other retro tech from the early 2000s.

I&#8217;ve been really enjoying the retro tech videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Techmoan">Techmoan </a>this year, so inspired by him I put together a YouTube video showing the organisers I owned and telling a bit of their story.
