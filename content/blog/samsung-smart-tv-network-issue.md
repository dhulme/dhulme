title: Samsung Smart TV Networking Issue
---

<BlogPostHeader />

I recently bought a Samsung RU7470 4K Smart TV. I connected it to the internet via wired ethernet and everything was working well, except that when I started the TV it would initially not have a network connection, an error message would be displayed and the previously opened app would stop working until I reloaded it. The worst offender was Disney+ app which wouldn't work until I reinstalled it!

I couldn't find any advice or solutions online, until I saw a post recommending for networking issues to configure the IP/DNS settings manually. This gave me an idea. Perhaps when the TV started it didn't have an IP address and the time it took to talk to the router and get an IP was enough for all the apps to break!

So under expert networking settings I looked at the current networking settings (IP/DNS/Gateway etc) and manually entered these same settings. I also configured my router to use that IP as a fixed IP for the TV.

Problem solved ðŸ˜ƒ
