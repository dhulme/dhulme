title: New site and Spotify Playlists web app
---

<BlogPostHeader />

The site has been rebuilt in [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) as [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) is now in maintenance mode. VitePress is built on more modern technologies, but has less features, so I had to get creative when migrating some functionality of the site!

I'm also publishing a first version of my [Spotify Playlists](pathname:///spotify-playlists) web app which allows Spotify users to modify their playlists in a more powerful way than the official Spotify client allows. Check it out and let me know any feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/dhulme/spotify-playlists)!
