title: Church Worship Backgrounds

<BlogPostHeader />

As part of my volunteering at <a href="http://kerith.co.uk">Kerith Community Church</a>, I have produced some motion backgrounds in Adobe After Effects for use during Sunday meetings. Feel free to use these in your own churches and meetings, and drop me an email &#8211; it would be great to hear how these are being used.

Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhYvcekzvgEoy-pHanGKAtgD4skJDGqIp">here</a> preview them on YouTube.
