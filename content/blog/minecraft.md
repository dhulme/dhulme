title: Minecraft Parody Videos

<BlogPostHeader />

With the help of two of my friends from Southampton, Dom and Jeremy, I produced several Minecraft videos, parodying the &#8216;Let&#8217;s play&#8217; genre. As I have now left Southampton, I will no longer be making any of these videos :(. I have embedded what I feel is the funniest video below. I will miss making these!
