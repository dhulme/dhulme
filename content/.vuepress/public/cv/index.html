          I am the Mitie technical lead for our React and Node web applications. I lead the development, oversee the web architecture, communicate with
          the product owners, and provide technical support and assistance to the development teams.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our team works mainly on the
          <a class="link" href="https://www.connectedworkspace.com/">Connected Workspace</a>, Mitie's strategy to digitally
          transform Facilities Management. We develop the Mozaic web portal, allowing customers to visualise data captured from
          sensors and gain insight into their employees wellbeing (through temperature, light levels and CO<sub>2</sub>
          concentration), utilisation of rooms and spaces, and the health of their building infrastructure. Mozaic is built using TypeScript React and MobX on the front-end,
          with a TypeScript Node.js and Express back-end utilising a microservices architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our web applications use single sign-on provided by Azure Active Directory. I led the design and development of a
          Node.js REST API service to manage user authorisation across Mitie applications. The service has 'resources' which
          represent any object in an external database which permissions can be stored against. Each time a user attempts to access
          data or complete an action, the API will check their permissions. This is a core part of Mitie's Connected Workspace infrastructure and
          therefore we ensured it performed well and all endpoints were properly tested.
        </p>
        <p>
          We worked in an agile team of 8 developers using Azure DevOps to manage our code, work items and build and release
          process. I introduced improvements to our workflow such as automatic code formatting, linting, code review policies and
          automated build and releases. I also designed and configured PaaS infrastructure in Azure.
				</p>
        <p>
          I improved Mite's developer recruitment process by creating interview questions and a technical test. Through this
          process we hired several great people including a graduate who I created and executed a learning plan for. He came with
          very little web experience and it was great seeing how quickly he picked up React and began making useful contributions
          to the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier this year, Mitie outsourced development to a partner in India. This transitioned my role to providing technical
          governance and support at a higher level. As part of this I have spent time researching new web technologies for Mitie
          such as Docker, GraphQL, WebAssembly (with Rust) and Svelte and RxJS.

          I was part of the digital products team, developing both client and server side code on a product for the exhibition and
          events industry built on the Meteor full stack framework, React and Redux. It enabled exhibition organisers to build
          their event floor plans on an interactive map, and allowed exhibitors to book stands and connect with the organisers.

          I worked with the team to address bugs and security issues, but felt progress wasn't made at the pace I wanted, and
          decided the role wasn't for me.

          I was part of the Technology &amp; Solutions team, responsible for technical architecture and governance, innovating new
          solutions and developing company products. I led the introduction of JavaScript ES6+ and the Vue front-end framework. As
          these new technologies were introduced, I provided training and technical support to the developers in the team and
          created project templates to ensure all new projects follow a consistent approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          I oversaw the development of two data visualisation projects, providing estimates, creating the code structure and
          distributing the work among developers. The first project used a custom framework I developed, including client side
          routing and a 2D canvas library. The second project led the introduction of front end frameworks to the company and
          utilised the Create.js canvas library. Both these projects were primarily targeting the iPad and I gained extensive
          experience of working through compatibility issues within iOS Web Views.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also led the development of an internal tool to improve the deployment process of HTML marketing presentations for the
          iPad. It replaced an existing solution and reduced human error and effort through automation. The system was built as a
          web application using the Meteor, enabling centralised logging of deployments and real-time data on deployments. During
          its first month of introduction, the average time spent on theses deployments was halved.

          For my 4<sup>th</sup> year in group design project, we developed a web application designed for video presentations in
          educational scenarios. A classroom of students could watch a video on a main screen, making annotations in real-time on
          their device and seeing a live timeline of others' annotations. In addition, second screen users were able to control
          the playback of the shared video. Our work received a First Class mark and was
