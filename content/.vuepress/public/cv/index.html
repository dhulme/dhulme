        I was part of the digital products team, working on a product for the exhibition 
        and events industry built on the Meteor full stack framework, React and Redux.
        It enabled exhibition organisers to build their event floor plans on an interactive map, and 
        allowed exhibitors to book stands and connect with the organisers.

        I developed both client and server side JavaScript code, reporting code debt, bugs and security 
        issues to the team. I started working with the team to address these issues, but felt progress
        wasn't made at the pace I wanted, and decided the role wasn't for me.

        I was part of the Technology &amp; Solutions team, responsible for technical architecture and governance,
        innovating new solutions and developing company products. I led the introduction of JavaScript ES6+, the Vue front-end
        framework and overhauled the front-end build process, helping to integrate better with the C# back-end stack. As these new 
        technologies were introduced, I provided training and technical support to the 15 developers in the team and created project
        templates to ensure all new projects follow a consistent approach. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I oversaw the development of two data visualisation projects, providing estimates, creating 
        the code structure and distributing the work among 3 developers. The first project
        used a custom framework I developed, including client side routing and a 2D canvas library,
        and was the first in the company to use a JavaScript module loading system. The second project
        led the introduction of front end frameworks to the company and utilised the Create.js canvas library.
        Both these projects were primarily targeting the iPad and I have extensive experience of working through compatibility issues
        within iOS Web Views.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using my experience on these projects, I developed a new company product: a series of
        single page web applications written in .NET and Vue, sharing code through npm packages and integrated together through a 
        single sign on system.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also led the development of an internal tool to improve the deployment process of HTML marketing presentations for the iPad.
        It replaced an existing solution and reduced human error and effort through automation.
        The system was built as a web application using the Meteor, enabling centralised logging of deployments and real-time data on deployments.
        During its first month of introduction, the average time spent on a deployment was halved from 33 minutes to 15 minutes.

        For my 4<sup>th</sup> year in group design project, we developed a web application designed for video presentations in educational scenarios.
        A classroom of students could watch a video on a main screen, making annotations in real-time on their device and seeing
        a live timeline of others' annotations. In addition, second screen users were able to control the playback of the shared video.
        Our system used MongoDB and Node.js with the Express framework, and a jQuery front-end using Web Sockets.
        Our work received a First Class mark and was <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-08596-8_7" class="link">published</a> and presented at the ICCHP 2014 conference.
