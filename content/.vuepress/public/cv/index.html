            end-users and developers.

          <p>
            I am the Mitie technical lead for our React and Node web applications. I lead the development, oversee the web
            architecture, communicate with the product owners, and provide technical support and assistance to the development
            teams.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our team works mainly on the
            <a class="link" href="https://www.connectedworkspace.com/">Connected Workspace</a>, Mitie's strategy to digitally
            transform Facilities Management. We develop a web portal which allows customers to visualise data captured from
            sensors and gain insight into their employees' wellbeing (through temperature, light levels and CO<sub>2</sub>
            concentration), utilisation of rooms and spaces, and the health of their building infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The portal is built using TypeScript React and MobX on the front-end, with a TypeScript Node.js and Express back-end
            utilising a microservices architecture. Single sign-on is provided by Azure Active Directory. I led the design and
            development of a Node.js REST API service to manage user authorisation across Mitie applications. The service allows
            for permissions to be stored for any object in an external database. Each time a user attempts to access data or
            complete an action, the API will check their permissions. This is a core part of Mitie's Connected Workspace
            infrastructure and therefore we ensured it had excellent performance and was thoroughly tested.
          </p>
          <p>
            We worked in an agile team of 8 developers using Azure DevOps to manage our code, work items and build and release
            process. I introduced improvements to our workflow such as automatic code formatting, linting, code review policies
            and automated build and releases. I also designed and configured PaaS infrastructure in Azure.
          </p>
          <p>
            I improved Mite's developer recruitment process by creating interview questions and a technical test. I interviewed
            candidates and we hired several excellent people including a graduate for whom I created and executed a learning plan.
            He came with very little web experience and it was great seeing how quickly he picked up React and began making useful
            contributions to the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last year Mitie outsourced development to a partner in India. This transitioned my role to managing an external
            development team, providing technical governance, support and assisting development. I have ensured that architectural
            decisions follow best practices and are consistent with Mite's approach. I've also researched new web technologies for
            Mitie such as Docker, GraphQL, WebAssembly and Svelte.
          </p>
          <p>
            More recently, I have written serverless Node APIs hosted in Azure and AWS. These APIs connect to a mobile application
            built in Xamarin enabling Mitie's cleaners to sign in and out of shifts and read news articles. I've also created a
            proof of concept for migrating this Xamarin application to React Native.

            I was part of the digital products team, developing both client and server side code on a product for the exhibition
            and events industry built on the Meteor full stack framework, React and Redux. It enabled exhibition organisers to
            build their event floor plans on an interactive map, and allowed exhibitors to book stands and connect with the
            organisers.

          <p>
            I worked with the team to address bugs and security issues, but felt progress wasn't made at the pace I expected, and

            I was part of the Technology &amp; Solutions team, responsible for technical architecture and governance, innovating
            new solutions and developing company products. I led the introduction of JavaScript ES6+ and the Vue front-end
            framework. As these new technologies were introduced, I provided training and technical support to the developers in
            the team and created project templates to ensure all new projects follow a consistent approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            I oversaw the development of two data visualisation projects, providing estimates, creating the code structure and
            distributing the work among developers. The first project used a custom framework I developed, including client side
            routing and a 2D canvas library. The second project led the introduction of front end frameworks to the company and
            utilised the Create.js canvas library. Both these projects were primarily targeting the iPad and I gained extensive
            experience of working through compatibility issues within iOS Web Views.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also led the development of an internal tool to improve the deployment process of HTML marketing presentations for
            the iPad. It replaced an existing solution and reduced human error and effort through automation. The system was built
            as a web application using Meteor, enabling centralised logging of deployments and real-time data on deployments.
            During its first month of introduction, the average time spent on deployments was halved.

            For my 4<sup>th</sup> year in group design project, we developed a web application designed for video presentations in
            educational scenarios. A classroom of students could watch a video on a main screen, making annotations in real-time
            on their device and seeing a live timeline of others' annotations. In addition, second screen users were able to
            control the playback of the shared video. Our work received a First Class mark and was
